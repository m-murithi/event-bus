### Express Event Bus

**Overview**
This repository provides an example of implementing an event bus with Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. An event bus facilitates communication between different parts of a system by allowing components to publish and subscribe to events asynchronously.

_Features_
- Demonstrates how to set up an event bus using Express.js.
- Provides examples of publishing and subscribing to events within an Express application.
- Offers best practices for implementing event-driven architecture with Express.
- Includes sample code snippets and explanations for better understanding.
  
**Technologies Used**
Express.js: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js

**Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/m-murithi/event-bus.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd event-bus
```
3. Install the dependencies using npm:
```
npm install
```

**Usage**
To see the event bus in action, start the Express server:
```
npm start
```
This will start the server and allow you to send requests to endpoints that publish and subscribe to events.

#### Implementation
The event bus implementation in this repository consists of the following components:
  eventBus.js: Contains the logic for managing event subscriptions and publishing events.
  routes/: Contains Express route handlers for publishing and subscribing to events.
  middleware/: Contains custom middleware for handling event-related tasks.
